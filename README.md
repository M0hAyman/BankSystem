## Dependencies for running the application
1- Java Development Kit (JDK):
You need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine to compile and run Java applications. Make sure you have JDK version 8 or higher installed.

2- JavaFX:
JavaFX is typically included in JDK distributions up to JDK 10. Starting from JDK 11, JavaFX has been decoupled from the JDK and is available as a separate module. You can download and install JavaFX from the OpenJFX website (https://openjfx.io/) or use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies.

3- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) (Optional):
While not strictly a dependency, using an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans can greatly simplify the development process and provide features like code completion, debugging, and project management.

4- Operating System:
JavaFX-based applications should run on any operating system that supports Java, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

5- Dependencies specified in the code or build configuration:
Depending on how your project is set up, you might have additional libraries or dependencies specified in the code itself or a build configuration file (e.g., Maven pom.xml file or Gradle build script). Make sure you have these dependencies installed or included in your project setup.
By ensuring you have these dependencies installed and set up correctly, you should be able to compile and run the Banking System Java desktop application on your machine.
